Hi, let me first introduce myself.
I am Pallav Agarwal, a sophomore at the department of
Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of
Technology, Kanpur. I love trying new tech, languages,
programs, operating systems.. Well, pretty much everything
remotely related to a computer.

It has been pointed out to me that I'm a _reinvent the wheel_
kind of guy. I built this website up from scratch without
using any prebuilt themes, pain as it was to get it
cross compatible. Even for the search functionality, I
wrote my own algorithm ([Behind The Scenes](/algo/))
instead of using the implementations available online
or using google custom search etc. My current operating
system is a finely configured Arch Linux on i3, a tiling
window manager. But that isn't custom enough, and so <s>I am
currently building my own operating system, using the
(B)LFS project.</s><br/>UPDATE: I finally finished my LFS project
when I ended up injecting Gentoo's package manager `Portage`
into my OS, essentially making it identical to Gentoo. I have
decided, for now, to stick with Arch Linux.

So, now I would like to offer an explanation,
I may like to reinvent the wheel, but I only do it
because everytime I complete one of my custom projects,
I end up adding a lot to my knowledge. To make this
blog, I learned CSS, HTML5, and a lot of Javascript.
To make the search functionality, I had to learn some
ruby, and NLP in python. The LFS project taught me more
about the linux operating system, than most linux
enthusiasts learn in a lifetime.

My only motive in creating this blog was so that
I could provide answers to some questions that
I had trouble finding the answers to.
