This tip may be obvious to many people, but I feel this worth mentioning. A lot of us
have SSH keys set up for github. I found out today, from a friend (github/sakshamsharma)
that you can actually share your public keys with others by giving them your github
username.
For example,

```
curl https://github.com/pallavagarwal07.keys >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

would give me ssh/scp access to your PC.
