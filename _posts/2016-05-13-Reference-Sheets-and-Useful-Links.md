This post was long due. I often find blog posts, reference sheets and useful links that
I feel I should bookmark. However, I often lose these bookmarks when I shift Operating
Systems or browsers (which happens very often). I am hoping that this will be a better
and a more reliable way to keep track of all these resources.

cheat sheat to write cross compatible code for both PYTHON-2 and PYTHON-3
