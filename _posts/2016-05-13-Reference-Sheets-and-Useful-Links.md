This post was long due. I often find blog posts, reference sheets and useful links that
I feel I should bookmark. However, I often lose these bookmarks when I shift Operating
Systems or browsers (which happens very often). I am hoping that this will be a better
and a more reliable way to keep track of all these resources.

1. [Python Future](http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html): This is a brilliant
cheat sheat to write cross compatible code for both PYTHON-2 and PYTHON-3
2. [What Color is Your Function?](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/):
An absolutely amazing article about the design choices of a *modern language*.
I won't spoil the surprise by revealing which language and what choices.
3. [Art of Unix Programming](http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/): If you aren't into reading
plain text articles, atleast go through the Appendix D. You'll find some hilarious
Unix bedtime stories :)
4. [Sorted vs Unsorted Array](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-it-faster-to-process-a-sorted-array-than-an-unsorted-array):
One of the most upvoted questions on stackoverflow. This may be obvious to me now,
but I wish I knew this before I took the Architecture course in IITK. Must Read.
5. [Undo Last Git Commit](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/927358/how-to-undo-last-commits-in-git):
Another one stolen from StackOverflow highest voted category.
