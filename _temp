One of the best things about vim is its ability to create
custom mappings for almost any key in all modes.

Suppose you want Ctrl+S to save your document while you are
in insert mode, because pressing

&lt;Esc&gt;:w&lt;Enter&gt;i


to switch to normal mode, save the file, and return back
to insert mode is a bit too much. According to vim philosophy,
it actually IS too much, and thus you can map Ctrl+S to
those keys just as easily.

For this, add the following to your vimrc

inoremap &lt;C-S&gt; &lt;Esc&gt;:w&lt;Enter&gt;i


EXPLANATION:

The command has separate parts but follows the format

&lt;cmd&gt; &lt;lhs&gt; &lt;rhs&gt;


The command maps lhs to rhs in the mode specified by cmd.
&lt;cmd&gt; can be further broken down in the following format:

&lt;mode&gt;[nore]map

where the following modes are common (All
modes can be viewed
here
or using :help map-modes)

(none): normal, visual, operator-pending mode
i: insert mode
v: visual mode
n: normal mode


nore is used for no-remapping, i.e. the default functions
of rhs and not their aliases will be used. When skipped,
The rhs will be further resolved if a remapping is found.
Vim, even has a max resolve-depth in case of an infinite loop.

For lhs and rhs the keys are named as follows:

&lt;C-a&gt; : Ctrl + a
&lt;S-a&gt; : Shift + a
&lt;A-a&gt; : Alt + a
&lt;C-S-a&gt; : Ctrl + Shift + a
&lt;Enter&gt;
&lt;BS&gt; : Backspace
etc..


The whole list can be viewed
here
or using the :help key-notation command inside vim.
