                                <p>AKA, how I got an internship in Google. In case you were wondering why the
actual title is so obscure, it is because I want this article to be mostly
linked by the rest of the (monthly) articles in this series (I'll update the
links as I write them)</p>

</ol>


<p>So, for those who know me, you'd know that getting into Google had been my
"dream" for a long time. And by long, I mean like when I was in class 8th/9th,
and I barely knew what programming meant. I used to look at tech companies and
read an article about how good the Google offices are, and the thought of me
working there just stuck. Let's go through the things I think are important.</p>

<h3>A Fair Resume</h3>

<p>I originally wrote "A good Resume", but frankly, I have seen people with not
a lot of experience get into Google, so I'm revising it to say "Fair".</p>

<p>I don't think this needs to be explained much. If you are from a good college,
have a fair CPI, it should be enough to get you an interview. If you don't,
you'd need some good projects up your sleeve, or good performance in programming
competitions. They don't expect you to be great, because contrary to our belief,
undergrads aren't expected to know everything in the whole universe.</p>

<p>One thing I would like to stress though is not to pile up your resume with weak
points just to make it longer. If you are a B.Tech. student, a good resume
would be around 1 page, unless you have done tons of projects. Truthfully, most
resumes that I've seen students make, are pretty long, and while its nice that
you are proud of a lot of things you did, do you really think that a Google
recruiter would give any weightage to the fact that you won the blindfold
Rubik's cube national competition?</p>

<p>Your Resume needs to be made differently for every company to apply to, and I
would suggest that you keep only the most important points on your Resume if
you apply to a Tech company like Google.</p>

<p>For reference, <a href="/res/resume.pdf">here</a> is a snapshot of the Resume I submitted
to Google - Short, Sleek and to the point.</p>

<h3>Application Procedure</h3>

<p>With fear of stating the obvious, to get into Google, you need to apply to
Google.  I mean really? Take my college for example. We have a placement cell
in which students register for campus placements. Now, if you sit for campus
placements, accepting an outside offer causes you to be labelled a "defaulter".
What this means for you is that you are allowed to sit for only 2 companies in
campus placements in the first week of next year.</p>

<p>This is one of the <em>only</em> things I don't like about my college. Look at this
from a game theoretic perspective. Let's follow a person's thought process:</p>

<ol>
<li>If I get the placement penalty, I'll get to sit for only two companies in my
final year.</li>
<li>If those two companies don't select me, I'll be jobless.</li>
<li>I don't want to be jobless.</li>
<li>I can't take penalty.</li>
<li>I have two choices, either only apply for campus placements, or only apply
outside.</li>
<li>There's a higher chance to get a job via campus placements.</li>
<li>I can't sit for outside placements.</li>
<li>I won't apply to Google.</li>
</ol>


<p>Unfortunately, I saw tens of people follow this thought process. None of them
even tried to apply to Google or Facebook or Amazon or any of the amazing
companies that didn't visit our college.</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with the above thought process, but if you would allow
me, I'd want you to ask yourself a couple of questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>If you get selected by Google, do you really think those 2 companies would
reject you?</li>
<li>If you can get selected in Google, can't you similarly apply off-campus next
year as well?</li>
<li>If you get selected in Google, would you really not go just because of a
penalty?</li>
<li>If (3) was yes, you'd actually get to reject Google! Wouldn't that boost
your morale?</li>
</ol>


<p>The truth is, people don't apply because they are lazy. Campus placements are
easy, they are less scary and completely inside our comfort zone. Nobody likes
getting rejected, and to apply to a company that they think is beyond them,
when they already have an acceptance, is useless effort. <em>Sigh</em></p>

<p>They are somewhat right. Getting rejected is no fun. <em>Hell, I got rejected by
Facebook after some pretty good interviews</em>, and the only suggestion I got from
my recruiter was "definitely encourage you to communicate more effectively
during an interview". It will take me some time to work on that...</p>

<p>Now that I've completely lost your attention, let's get to how you can actually
apply to Google. There are primarily two ways.</p>

<p>The first is to apply online through Google's portal. If you are a first or
second year undergrad, you can apply for an Engineering Practicum Intern (which
I didn't know existed :/ ), and if you are third year or above, you can apply
for a Software Engineering Intern. You can view the exact details on
https://careers.google.com</p>

<p>The second is to apply through a referral.</p>

<p>The catch is, when you apply through the online portal, there is some chance
that your resume would not pass the automated screening. While Google does a
good job of selecting good resumes, there still remains a possibility that your
resume will never be seen by a real person. If your resume is not machine
readable for example, this would dump any chance of your getting selected (or
even getting shortlisted).</p>

<p>Applying through a referral ensures that your resume will be seen by a real
person. Sounds like partiality? Well, yeah, sort of. The fact is, successful
referral incentives mean that the Googler referring you would actually ensure
that you are a good candidate before forwarding your resume. This is like a
spam protection, and will prevent resumes filled with singing and table tennis
achievements from reaching a recruiter.</p>

<p>Now, for my friends at IIT Kanpur, I would like to tell you that you have
absolutely brilliant Alumnus with a lot of them working at Google, Facebook and
all the other top companies and it would be very easy for you to take the
second procedure above. Consider yourself very lucky.</p>

<p>In my case, I didn't take a referral from an Alumni, but rather from Google
Summer of Code.  I have blogged about GSoC before and so feel free to read
about it more. Basically, on successful completion of a project, GSoC provides
you with a one time Google Referral that you can "redeem" any time in the future
for any position you wish. Since I was interested in the internship, I took the
referral and applied.</p>

<p>So you apply, and wait.</p>

<p>Until someone from Google either mails you, or calls you.</p>

<p>Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!! I got a call! Now what?</p>

<p>Dance. I mean it. You have crossed the most difficult part. Now the rest of the
process is easy to follow, because its pretty straightforward. You schedule the
interviews with your recruiter, and the person calls you for the interview at
the exact schedule time.  You try to answer the questions and code the problems
the best you can, and wait for the next call/email. If you get through all
interviews, Congrats!</p>

<p>This is also the point when any favoritism ends. It doesn't matter how you
applied, who you are, where you are from, how your resume was. After this
point, you will be judged solely on your performance in the interviews.</p>

<h3>Timeline</h3>

<p>So you can get articles like these anywhere. Why read mine? Because I like to
include personal experience, and I wish more people did. It helps a lot to know
what to expect at each step of the process. So let's go through the timeline -
or rather how much I was made to wait for every step of the road.</p>

<h3>Few random points about the interview</h3>

<p>I had to give three technical interviews, and one project interview. This would
be different for different people.  Usually, they start with two technical
interviews, and if they are not sure, they take one more. Once the technical
interviews are done, one of two things can happen - Either you get an offer
first, and then you sit for project interviews (with much less pressure, since
it is no longer deciding your fate), or as in my case, you'd be asked to sit
for project interviews, and you'd get an offer IF you get selected in a project
within 6 weeks.</p>

<p>For me, the project interviews were easier, because I experiment
a lot with random tech and software, however, for many people it does take 6
weeks and it is possible for you to not get a project at all. All I can say is
that gaining knowledge beyond your college books would help a lot.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, the interviews are NOT tough. The questions asked in
my technical interview were the sort of questions you would expect on the mid term
exam of Algorithms and Data Structures. They focus on your ability to code the solution
you propose, and how efficient and clean your solution is.</p>

<p>During the project matching phase, telling your recruiter about your strengths and
interests would help as he/she would be able to match you with relevant teams more
quickly AND you would be able to get a team you'd enjoy working in (win-win).</p>

<p>This is all I can remember about my experience for now. I may update this
article with more points as I remember them. I know the whole article has been
unstructured and jumpy, and its mostly because I waited too long to write this
article and now "fragmented" is exactly how I would describe my memory of the
experience. If you have any specific questions, ping me on Facebook. You'll
find the contact details on the "About Me" page on top.</p>

<p>I'd only leave you with one thought. Do you really think you would regret the
experience even if you tried and failed?</p>

<p>Thanks, and have a nice day :)</p>
